# NFT Mechanics Report 2022 - Working Group Notes

These are the notes of the working group implementing the **NFT Mechanics Report 2022**. This research is organized as an iterative development of a note collection in a Zettelkasten-like structure using GitHub and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Any user can upload this database into Obsidian to visualize the network of different projects and explore our innovative classification of the diverse NFT market.

## How It Works

We use eight kinds of notes to structure our research. While it may seem complex at first, it will make sense as you navigate through the notes.

### 1. **Thought Note**
- **Purpose:** Represents a unit of thinking about any concept or idea.
- **Structure:**
  - One clear point per note.
  - The note title (filename) should summarize the thought in one sentence.
  - Inbound link from the previous thought.
  - Use hashtag `#permanent` at the end.

### 2. **Source Note**
- **Purpose:** Summarizes the relevant content of a source.
- **Structure:**
  - Follow the structure from [[0rg — minimal viable source note]].
  - Other notes **never** reference sources directly, but always reference source notes.
  - Use hashtag `#source` at the end.

### 3. **Project Note**
- **Purpose:** Describes all functionalities of a specific project.
- **Structure:**
  - Categorized projects are listed in the corresponding registry.
  - If functions are cloned from another project, link to that project note.
  - If there is a unique spin on the mechanism, create a **link note** and reference through it.
  - Follow the structure from [[0rg — minimal viable project note]].
  - Use hashtag `#project` at the end.

### 4. **Link Note**
- **Purpose:** Links two items in a meaningful way that deserves its own elaboration.
- **Core Use Cases:**
  1. **Connecting Threads:** If you have a thought that connects different threads, create a link note that references the corresponding notes and explains the connection.
  2. **Emerging Patterns:** When several constructions resemble the same idea, create a link note that connects the respective projects/patterns/thoughts.
- **Structure:**
  - Use hashtag `#link` at the end.

### 5. **Registry Note**
- **Purpose:** Contains links to notes that list projects or start thought threads.
- **Structure:**
  - May include sections or paragraphs explaining classifications.
  - May have a maintainer and an inbox section for new items.
  - Ensure that every Thought and Project is connected to a registry or a chain of thoughts that trace back to a registry.
  - Use hashtag `#registry` at the end.

### 6. **Fleeting Note**
- **Purpose:** Captures random, half-baked thoughts that may be developed later.
- **Structure:**
  - Must be listed in your own fleeting registry.
  - Write a good summary as the filename.
  - Link it to all relevant notes to maximize collaboration opportunities.
  - Allocate time to clean up your fleeting notes.
  - Use hashtag `#fleeting` at the end.

### 7. **Stub Project Note**
- **Purpose:** Placeholder for projects referenced in the knowledge base but not yet fully developed.
- **Structure:**
  - If possible, turn the stub into a proper project note.
  - Write a message in the corresponding inbox linking the stub note.
  - Use hashtag `#stub_project`.
  - If converting to a proper project note, update the structure and hashtags accordingly.

### 8. **Personal Note**
- **Purpose:** A page about a contributor, anchoring their personal inbox and fleeting notes.
- **Structure:**
  - All personal notes are listed in the personal registry, along with initials.
  - Use hashtag `#personal` at the end.

### General Guidelines
- **Sign Your Notes:** Always sign your notes as per rule 1.3.
- **Collaborate:** Take the time to read and skim through other contributors' notes. If you find connections or have thoughts of your own, add them to the network. Use Obsidian's graph view for better visualization.
- **Clean Up:** If you spot something confusing or incorrect in the core work, ask the contributor to elaborate or clean it up.

This structured approach helps us maintain a comprehensive and interconnected knowledge base, driving forward our research on NFT mechanics.
