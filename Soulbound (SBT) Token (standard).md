Soulbound tokens as non-transferable NFTs that can help represent a person's identity and achievements in Web3.

NB:  Idexo claims that they launched the first SBT in April 2021, 12 months before the whitepaper that named them. (They also offer the software where they can be easily minted). [Source](https://idexo.com/soulbound-tokens.html)
