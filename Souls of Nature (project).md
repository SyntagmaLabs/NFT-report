 An NFT as an animal 3D avatar; user can explore the world, interact with other animals. One can play with a free avatar (you choose among 3 animals) or buy a rare animal avatar, part of revenue goes to environmental charity.   There will be a total of 9,271 NFTs uniquely generated, each with both visible and non-visible traits. Main function of NFT is to grant an access to the Souls of Nature metaverse, it is also a character inside the experience.

There are also signs that the project implies some sort of [[Transformation (mechanic)]]:

```
After being re-born as young cub, there is a vast journey ahead that will mold and define the evolution of your animal spirit. Quests, dangers and challenging tasks will each unlock a fraction of your soul.
```

### NFT properties

Our genesis NFT collection is composed by 9,271 young Animal Souls. They are new to the world and have not yet faced the harsh difficulties that the nature world is experiencing. All these souls are new and in its purest form.

Every Animal Soul NFT is unique and has both visual and non-visual features. These features will determine the rarity of your Animal Soul.

**Non-visual features**
-   Dexterity 
-   Wisdom 
-   Empathy
-   Soul energy

-   Personality
-   Gender
Every animal soul re-borns into a baby animal avatar for holders to use for the whole Souls of Nature experience. This NFT will grant access to special events, airdrops, and other benefits as the project evolves.
