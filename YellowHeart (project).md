## Products:
Direct quote from the ws:
```
* Smart Tickets that engage fans, limit fraud and let ticket issuers participate in resale revenues
* Digital Memberships -- so your biggest fans can purchase exclusive access to content, perks and special offers
* Digital Communities that create direct and lasting relationships between ticket issuers and their fans
* Gated Access Media -- so that access to streaming music and video is limited to only holders of specific NFTs
```


## How to redeem NFT?
Create anÂ yellowheart account, an openseas account, a metamask wallet, link all of them, redeem NFT in the yellowheart app afterwards.

NB! People had serious problems to redeem NFT vinyl, a lot of frustration in Reddit. More info: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kingsofleon/comments/lz6uez/how_do_i_redeem_my_nft_vinyl/)
