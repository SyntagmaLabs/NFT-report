### A Semi-Fungible Token

Defines a specification where [[ERC-721 Standard]] compatible tokens with the same SLOT and different IDs are fungible.

> ERC-3525 Semi-Fungible Token (Final Sep. 2022) is a general-purpose and asset-agnostic token standard that powers the state-of-the-art digital representation of ownership, value, rights, status, and identity. Developed by Solv Protocol, ERC-3525 rewrites the generation of trading of digital assets, creating efficiencies and enhancing market integrity. With it, traditionally illiquid assets, such as bond, company equity, ABS, real estate, and renewable energy, can become divisible, represented on-chain, and traded freely in an open market.
