### Summary
(*what the source seems to be about*)

### Thoughts
Takeaways from the source that we want to reference. 
* Don't put thoughts here, make a quote or a rephrase with a page number. Then if you have a thought stemming from the source, make a [[README#How it works|permanent note]], put it in a registry and reference this note from theree. 
* If the source is large (a book / an article with many good things), use h4 (#### Title) for quotes from each topic. This will allow to make Obsidian links directly to the relevant part.
* If more content remains in the source than gets summarized here, please make a small mention. This way the reader will know if it may be worth it to check out the source as well, or is this note sufficient.
