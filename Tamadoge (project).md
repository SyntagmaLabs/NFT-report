#### NB: the project is at developement stage, most of described mechanics are still a part of roadmap, the metaverse is not launched yet at the moment of writing.

An NFT as a virtual pet (tamagochi), they have different type of rarity determining their price. Each Tamadoge pet is minted as a baby but then grows into adult if you take care of it  which relates the project to[[Transformation (mechanic)]]. Caring includes buying food, toys, cosmetic items. 

### NFT properties
Each Tamadoge pet has certain properties, including the appearance, strengths and weaknesses. If one takes care of a pet, these strengths can be developed. Adutl pets can be used in battle games, the winner will be listed among top-players. (In other sources, it was mentioned that players who have developed their pets the most will receive the highest rewards from the prize pool).

No restriction on the total number of pets that a user can buy. The pets can be traded on the secondary markets (not implemented yet as an NFT launch will be in Oct 2022) 
The project doesn't describe what will happen if one doesn't take care of a pet. Presumably, the pet does not die but doesn't grow into adults and thus can't participate in battle games.
