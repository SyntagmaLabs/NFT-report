**Chains**: Ethereum

Sandbox is one of the first and biggest metaverse plays to date. It runs scarce NFT land, land editor, a model editor, and a game editor.

## NFTs
Sandbox runs two types of NFTs: for land ownership and for 3d models usable in the game.

### Lands & Estates
Lands follow the concept of [[Virtual location ownership rights (mechanic)]].

Lands are an **ERC-721** token, with a finite supply of 166,464. Each land NFT represents a parcel of 96x96 in-game meters where players can build and park assets. There is a global map where each land occupies a specific place.

Users can combine multiple lands into an estate, supposedly for ease of editing.

### Assets
Aside from lands, there are 3d models (UGC) which users can add and sell and land owners can buy and add on their lands as assets.

## Fungibles
### SAND
The project has a fungible token for governance and value capture.
