An NFT as a [[Revenue sharing (mechanic)]]
### How it works
Any artist can issue NFT tokens to mark their music as long as they meet the criteria of the platform. Special criteria should be released before the launch of ROCKI Version 2.0. NFT can be traded to anyone freely with an agreed contract cosign between the seller and the buyer. NFT owner can enjoy the income allocated to the music NFTed and the specific formula will also be released before the launch of ROCKI Version 2.0.For premium subscription, music NFTed has more weight (5 times of music not NFTed) when counting the time length listened to, which means the artist can earn more incomes than those artists who has no music NFTed.
