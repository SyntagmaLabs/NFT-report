> Regenerative Resources (RRC) is an ecosystem services company that aims to transform degraded land into productive seawater landscapes. 
	RRC announced that it will launch five dynamic Short Film NFTs designed by prominent artists, the funds from which will be used to seed and grow 100 million mangroves across RRCâ€™s current projects. 
	Each Short Film NFT will initially have only a single frame. However, every time an NFT is bought or resold, more frames will be released in a continuous process until the NFT holder can view the entire short film.
