>When two Axies give their love to each other, they will create the ultimate product of love: an Axie Egg. Over time, the Eggs will grow into Adult Axie.
>
>-   After 24 hours, an Egg will hatch into an adorable Larva.
>-   After 48 hours, a Larva will morph into a Petite Axie.  
    _(Axies will need a transaction to continue growing)_
>-   After 48 hours, a Petite will grow into an Adult Axie.  
    _(Axies will need a transaction to continue growing)_
