The project is an infrastructure play, running its own L2 network and a range of SaaS offerings connected to blockchain and NFT usage.

A notable mention is private NFTs.

## Private NFTs
**Source**: [Launching Private NFTs on Arcana — Arcana Blog](https://arcana.network/blog/launching-private-nfts-on-arcana/)

Arcana uses its own encryption nodes and file storage in order to offer private NFT content. It works, roughly, as follows:
1. A newly uploaded file gets encrypted by a unique key secretly shared through a cryptographic scheme among Arcana nodes
2. A blockchain record is created to track who is eligible to see the content of the file (in this example — whoever is holding the NFT in question)
3. Whenever a user wants to view the file,
	1. Her browser sends a request to Arcana nodes
	2. Arcana nodes check what the access conditions are (holding the NFT)
	3. Arcana nodes check if the user holds the required NFT
	4. Arcana nodes decrypt the content and show it to the user
