Collab.Land is a SaaS community management tool for Discord and Telegram that allows access restrictions based on blockchian-related checks. One of those is ownership of an NFT.

The typical user flow looks as follows:
1. A user receives a link to join a Telegram group
2. The link leads to a Collab.Land bot which greets the user and asks to go to a Web link
3. The user goes to a Web link which asks to authenticate with Metamask
4. The user signs a message with Metamask (proving ownership of a wallet). The backend checks that the wallet holds the required NFT and sends the user back to Telegram
5. The Telegram bot gives the user the link to join the token-gated chat
6. Regular checks are performed, and if user loses the NFT, she is kicked from the chat
