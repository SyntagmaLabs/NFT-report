**Chain**: Ethereum

**Standard**: [[ERC-792 Standard (not an NFT standard)]]



### Note: 
### Not an NFT, more like a record on chain, even though it has a lot of similar properties of NFTs (?)
### EXCEPTIONS: 
* Can't be traded/ exhcanged. 
* One individual can't have more than 1 PoH
* No permanent ownership: one needs to reapply every 2 years. 
* No limits of total supply of PoH

### What does it include:
* first name & last name
* wallet + wallet balance
* Bio (optional?)
* who have vouched for the person (~proved that it is a real human)
* Social media (Twitter?)

### What can you do with it?
1) receive Universal Basic Income (UBI) token
2) access voting in DAOs (1 human = 1 vote). E.g. it could be added as a plugin to common DAO tools such as Colony, Aragon, or DAOstack
3) be used as a universal login method: imagine dapps recognizing users automatically without the need for registration.
4) Showcase certifications or reputation points (such as credit scoring) in the public PoH profile. It can include country of citizenship, degrees and professional certifications, skills badges, etc.
5) access to Airdrops
6) as alternative to captchas to access some space in order to avoid spam

### How to register (verification process):
1) Connect with Metamask, submit the application info
2) Short video including speech and face and an Ethereum address linked to your profile
3) User vouching with one verification from registered profiles required. (At least one already register user should confirtm that you are a human)
