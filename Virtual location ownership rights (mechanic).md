## Concept
The NFT represents ownership of a digital location in a virtual world. Ownership gives rights of:
1. Transfer
2. "Building" (adding 3d assets and interactive components to the scene)
3. *(sometimes)* Access gating (who gets to enter the land parcel)

## Context
The concept has existed pre-NFT in many forms, including such examples as house ownership in [Ultima Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_Online) and virtual real estate in [Second Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life) (neither of which qualifying for an earliest known example).

## Characteristics (hypothesis)
1. There is usually a global map of all land parcels which introduces a differentiation method, e.g. central locations vs edge locations. (Not unique to metaverse/NFT.)
2. The total amount of land in projects that sell land is usually finite and fixed in the NFT contracts as a hard limit (to claim scarcity and build a case for a non-zero value of a land parcel). (Finite quantity also isn't unique to metaverse/NFT, although NFTs allow to set a hard limit.)
3. At least in theory, the virtual location can be made infrastructurally independent from any central party. This means that, for instance, if Second Life goes out of business and shuts down its servers, all land and buildings will cease to exist. Meanwhile, [[Decentraland (project)|Decentraland]] does not depend on a central party in the same sense: ownership is tracked on blockchain, rendering works through the frontend (i.e. user-hosted) and is open-sourced, digital assets are lightweight and/or can be stored on IPFS. There are numerous caveats to this example, but the long-term vision has full independence. (Unique to the blockchain world.)

## Projects
1. [[Decentraland (project)]]
2. [[Sandbox (project)]]
3. [[CyberTribe (project)]]
