An NFT as a Proof of Attendance Protocol NFT (a badge proving that you visited an event/gained an experience). Indirectly related to [[Token-gated access (mechanic)]] 

**Utility:**
* for users: to prove the places they've been to and earn bragging rights.
* for organizers: to engage with the event visitors & additional feature to promote

## How does it work?

Users should be on the lookout for QR codes in POAP sponsored events in order to collect badges and participate in different activities.
