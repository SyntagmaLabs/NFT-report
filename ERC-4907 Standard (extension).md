ERC-4907 is an extension of the [[ERC-721 Standard]] used in renting NFTs projects.
 
It adds an additional “User role” that would represent a renter with limited rights. ERC-4907 also includes an “expires” function that would automatically reset the user role without the need for a second on-chain transaction.
