An NFT as automatically generated set of properties (words) refering to avatar appearance; belongs to [[Virtual avatar (mechanic)]]. 
Unique feature that the whole range of words was placed in blockchain.
Potential utility is using it for random generation of avatars in other projects.

Often, sources refer to Loot as a [[Bottom-up approach to NFT]].
