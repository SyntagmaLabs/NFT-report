Pods is a Yet Another options and structured products protocol on Ethereum. It runs options, option strategies, and some other weird assets.

## Early Adopter NFT Badge (intended for governance)
Pods plans to deploy NFTs as rewards to early investors and adopters, representing a stake in the protocol. A blog post communicates that NFT holders are expected to take an active position in the community and in governance later down the line.

There are three types of NFTs given out, all in a centralized manner analogous to an airdrop.
1. Early community — discretionary
2. "New frens" (vampire) — have an interaction with one of the other options protocols (such as Opyn or Hegic) and interact with Pods contracts
3. LPs — an NFT with an aggregated "LP score" of that address, measured within a set time window

## Option Positions (not NFT)
Pods runs options which (without a deep examination) appear as fungible series.

## Structured products (not NFT)
Pods plans to offer one-transaction investment into yielding strategies. At the time of writing they only have one type: a long Lido position plus an option strangle strategy (long strangle — long OOM put + long OOM call).
