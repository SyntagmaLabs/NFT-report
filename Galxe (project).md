The Galxe Passport is a Soulbound Token tied to a wallet address distinguishing a verified individual
**Utility**:  use this as your universal identity across different applications for compliance purposes.

#### How does a registration happen?
1) The third-party "Persona" integrated with Galxy collects data for verification, collects PII (Personal Identifiable Information), approves it, send back the approval to Galxy. 
2) Signing stage: after approval from Persona, all data is encrypted. From now on, only user can access it by passowrd. Galxe Passport is created within the plattform and stored
3) Now the owner user can now mint the Galxe Passport SBT using their contract
