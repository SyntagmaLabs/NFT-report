### Summary
The report aims to establish a baseline for the entire field of DeFi at publication time:
* Motivation (relevance of DeFi for the world of finance)
* Classification (how to categorize projects by function)
* Inherent characteristics: 
	* What's the improvement over TradFi
	* Current and inherent shortcomings
* Patterns and constructions that underpin the projects
* Technological context (what changed so it all became possible / relevant)

### Thoughts
(*If there were any important poitns that we want to refer to from Redefine 2020, they'd be summarized here with page numbers.*)
