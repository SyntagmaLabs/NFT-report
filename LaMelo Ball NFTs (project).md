An NFT as a visual reflection of statistics of player's perfomance, evloving in time according to [[Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs) (mechanic)]]

### Decription

>In the past year, professional sports players such as LaMelo Ball—a rising star in the NBA—have created pioneering dNFTs that leverage Chainlink Sports Data Feeds to redefine player-fan relationships. 
	There are currently eight different [LaMelo Ball NFTs](https://blog.chain.link/how-lamelo-ball-dynamic-nfts-redefine-player-fan-experience/), with each NFT recording a different set of LaMelo’s player statistics, from rebounds and assists to points scored. NFT holders can receive special access to raffles and other NFT-specific perks based on LaMelo’s ongoing performance. 
	One of these eight NFTs, the Gold Evolve NFT, came with a unique promise: If LaMelo Ball won Rookie of the Year for the 2021 NBA season, the NFT itself would evolve to reflect a new image. LaMelo won the award and the NFT evolved.
	LaMelo Ball NFTs are a prime example of dNFTs that change continuously based on external data. In this case, LaMelo’s player statistics are constantly updated on-chain within the NFT and can trigger display upgrades, rewards, and more.
