## Concept
A private NFT is an NFT with a piece of content (most often, a picture or a video) viewable only by the holder of the NFT. It may also have a "public" item attached to it, but the core property is derived from having a hidden piece of content.

## Implementation
There are many SaaS projects offering this functionality, one of them is [[Arcana network (project)]].

The trick with private NFTs is in an infrastructural dependency. A public NFT can theoretically be fully independent, as ownership can be tracked by blockchain (independent), and metadata can sit in decentralized storage (potentially independent).

With privacy, there is one more component: access restriction. It is hard to properly implement in a decentralized setting. (`AB` is responsible to fill this if we need to elaborate on specifics.)
