A Dynamic NFT or dNFT, is a type of NFT that can change some of its inherent properties based on external conditions. These changes are recorded and added to the metadata of the NFT. 

The mechanic enables changes in visual features: the image/avatar evolves into something else as a result of some actions or simply as a result of time passing

### What way do NFTs change?

### The principle behind it:
> Smart contracts provide instructions on how the dNFT’s metadata should be changed given a triggering event based on external data through an oracle or an on-chain event. 
>
>A base NFT is created first, after which smart contracts that govern updates, unlocking hidden traits or features, and image enhancements are put into place. These changes are conditional and only happen when a smart contract is triggered. Each smart contract can be triggered by events that can be on-chain or off-chain, as well as time, price, or location-based events.

### How to mint dNFT?
>1.  Set up the ERC721 token 
>2.  Upload the NFT image links in the IPFS URIs 
>3.  Complete a compile check
>4.  Make the NFT contract “Keepers Compatible” 
>5.  Have the smart contract interact with Chainlink Price feeds that will change the NFT based on your defined variables (in this case, market prices). 
>6.  Test your dNFT to see if it is dynamically updating as expected. 
>7.  Mint and deploy your dNFT!
