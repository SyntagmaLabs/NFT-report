An NFT as an AI component that "brigns NFT to life" (they call it Personality Pod).
Also, they call their NFTs as an iNFT -- an Interactive and Intelligent NFT  because they use AI technology.

Currently, AI services include Recite, Broadcast and Interact modes:

> Recite allows you to upload your own audio that the iNFT then lip syncs to. Broadcast allows you to create a custom video using the iNFT’s voice. Interact offers the unique experience of being able to converse in real-time with the iNFT, asking it questions from, “What is your favorite metaverse?” to “What is the meaning of life?”.

All NFT avatars can be used in [[Noah's Ark (project)]] - an Intelligent Metaverse built on the iNFT Protocol.

### Avatar builder
![[Alethea_avatar_builder.png]]

While creating/fusing avatar [[Virtual avatar (mechanic)]], a user chooses:
1) the avatar's apprearance ('body'). It usually represented by the NFT the user already has
2) Soul -- the AI component, intelligence of an avatar. There are 4 levels of accessable AI functionality, the 4th is the highest.
3) Persona -- characteristics of the avatar, behavioral patterns
4) Voice - prerecoded or automatically generated voice

### Utility of iNFT (hypothetical):


>1) Virtual Influencers
Depending on the intelligence level of your iNFT, it will be able to interact and have real-time conversations, create content, and even produce generative art, music, and copy.
>
>2) Digital Twins
Create a digital twin by interacting with, and feeding your iNFT your thought processes and personality. With each interaction, the AI Engine will learn to make your iNFT more like you.
>
>3) Brand Ambassadors
Feed your iNFT Information about your brand and create a personality that fits your brand's goals - your iNFT will be the ultimate Brand Ambassador, always available and ready to help.
>
>4) AI Companions
By creating a personality that fits your needs, you can interact with it and build a relationship as a companion. The AI Engine will learn your preferences and feed the proper datasets to your iNFT to build and grow its capabilities to better understand and respond to your needs.
>
>5) Digital Guides / Coaches
You can shape your iNFT into a digital guide or virtual coach. With each interaction, as the AI Engine applies the proper datasets to the iNFT, its knowledge and personality will become more proficient.
>
>6) Virtual Assistants
Virtual Assistants or Digital Interns can be valuable and helpful tools. You can train your iNFT to provide support and assist you on your Web 3 journey, and with each interaction your iNFT gets smarter and more capable in assisting you.

### How is [[Fusion (mechanic)]] realized?

1. Merge your NFT (it can be [[ERC-721 Standard]] or [[ERC-1155 Standard]]) with their Personality Pod [[ERC-721 Standard]]
2. After the fusion, you receive an iNFT - your previous NFT now can be interacted with / trained.

### What AI components it might include?

### Future applications (hypothetical)

>  a) **Cryptopunk Rap battle on Twitch 24/7:** A cryptopunk will soon be able to talk to you and rap against another crypto punk in a battle watched by millions,  
> b)  **Interactive Exclusive Experiences:** Your Hashmask may laugh at your jokes and inspire you with its origin story  
> c) **Digital Farmer:** Your decentraland parcel will remind you to cultivate the land you have purchased.  
> d) **V for Vendetta, “We all all V”:** A community can organize a fractionally owned Character, and only token holders have the exclusive ability to unlock the IP of the character for rapid permissioned meme and content generation.
