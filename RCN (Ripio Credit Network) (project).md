### Mortgage NFTs for LAND parcels NFTs in [[Decentraland (project)]]
For those who can't afford to buy Decentraland land


**NB: the project was integrated with Decentralend in 2018, but it's no longer available in 2022**

### How does it work?

Technically, it is a P2P mortgage: a borrower sends a request to the *** marketplace, which specifies the conditions: the desired parcel, the requested amount, interest rate, duration, etc. A borrower is obligated to pay at least 10% of the requested amount.
A lender (if they like the conditions) accepts the loan, buys out the parcel and shares the ownership rights with a borrower. If the amount isn't paid after a certain period, a lender claims back the parcel; a borrower loses the paid 10% (or more).
The project was fully integrated with Decentraland, users didn't have to visit *** website, and everything was done through the Decentraland interface.

There were no details about KYC, the risk of borrower's default calculation or any other personal details. It seems that the lenders had to simply guess the reliability of the deal.

No details about restrictions on NFT ownership either.
