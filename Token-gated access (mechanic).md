## Concept
Access to a certain piece of content or a webpage is restricted only to holders of a specific NFT. There are several flavors of this mechanic:
1. "Bonus content" for NFT holders — e.g. creators offering hidden perks to holders of their NFTs. One of the industry terms is "[[Private NFTs (mechanic)]]". 
2. Access restriction (web) — webpages using NFT ownership as authentication (similar to how login credentials were used to restrict a website or a portion of it)
3. Access restriction (social) — social spaces such as Discord servers or Telegram chats requiring an NFT verification. Example: [[Collab.Land (project)]]

### Projects:
1. [[YellowHeart (project)]]
2. MintGate
3. CharmVerse
4. Rally
5. FWB Gatekeeper
6. Bonfire
7. Coinvise
