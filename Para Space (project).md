```
ParaSpace is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to borrow and lend against Non-Fungible and Fungible tokens alike. ParaSpace allows users to tap into otherwise-unused capital to fund further investments and earn yields on the same.
```

```
Para Space allows NFT owners to borrow ERC-20 fungible tokens against a wide range of non-fungible investments, and ERC-20 holders can collect yields in lending against those NFT's.
```

```
Deposit your ERC-721 and ERC-20 assets on Para Space to use as collateral for borrowing and to earn yields.
Earn interest yield: ERC-20 tokens supplied earn a share of interest paid by borrowers of those assets.
Borrow from the lending pool: A user may borrow from a pool of ERC-20 tokens against ERC-721 Non-fungible tokens and/or ERC-20 tokens as collateral. Borrowers can hold their borrow positions so long as the value of collateral keeps their account in good health, and they may repay their loan over time.
