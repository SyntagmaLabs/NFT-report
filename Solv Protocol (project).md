### Bonds

>Solv Protocol provides the first on-chain bond market that bridges TradFi with DeFi, featuring two types of bonds: Bond Voucher and Convertible Bond.
>
>The Bond Voucher is a debt SFT tailor-made for crypto institutions such as market makers, VCs, or asset management protocols, or DAOs seeking to bootstrap liquidity, exercise market-neutral trading strategies, or fund operations.
>
  The Convertible Bond works similarly to the Bond Voucher except that it has embedded convertibility by which the lender can convert the bond into the borrowerâ€™s token collateral under certain circumstances. DAOs or protocols that have treasury diversification and other general financing needs and want to attract the lenders with an asset's upside should consider issuing a Convertible Bond.
