An NFT changes over time. The types of changed may include (*hypothesis*):
1) [[Ð¡hanges in size (mechanic)]]: several NFTs are combined into a bigger NFT or parcel or collection
2) [[Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs) (mechanic)]]: changes in visual features: the image/avatar evolves into something else as a result of some actions or simply as a result of time passing
3) [[Breeding (mechanic)]]: several (usually two avatars) NFTs are breeded together to create a new NFT with random combination of characteristics from both "parental" NFTs
4) [[Fusion (mechanic)]]: several (usually an avatar + some special effect/power) NFTs are combined together to create a new NFT with stronger characteristics and higher rarity.
