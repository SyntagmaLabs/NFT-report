An NFT as a sports moments (mostly goals in soccer) & fantasy soccer.

4 levels of rarity:
* COMMON MOMENTS
* SPECIAL MOMENTS
* EPIC MOMENTS
* LEGENDARY MOMENTS


### How is [[Fusion (mechanic)]] realized?

**The purpose:**  "By burning forever repeated copies of the same moment, you will give birth to a fused copy of that moment" (Source: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realfevr/status/1539956662282469376?t=1Uwb_ejj-vhMTqf6XZdbYw&s=19))


1. Only NFTs of the same rarity can be fused together
2. Fused NFTs can be fused again:

```
The fusion process doesn’t end after the first fusion. In fact, you can assemble several fused NFTs from the same moment and create a superior fusion. The higher the fusion level, the lower the number of possible mints. Also, the rarer the NFT tier, the lower the number of repeated moments needed to perform a fusion.
```

3. The original NFTs that were merged together get burned. 

### Utility of fusion:

They mention that NFTs can be used in FEVR Battle Arena, but no details on what this is. Presumably, it's fantasy soccer game.
