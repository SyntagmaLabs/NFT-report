### Zerion Genesis NFT Collection

```
Each NFT got a randomly assigned rarity with these probabilities:

Legendary — 0.1%
Rare — 15.3%
Common — 84.6%
Besides the rarity score, each card has another attribute: generation. It’s zero for all NFTs from the Zerion Genesis Collection.
```

```
Zerion charges a 0.5% fee on swaps done through its trading aggregation: Zerion scans major DEXes and DEX aggregators, finding the best swap rates, taking into account gas costs and slippage.

Wallets that hold Zerion NFTs get 100% discounts on Zerion’s fees:

Legendary and Rare Zerion Genesis NFTs get zero fees forever,
Common Zerion Genesis NFTs get zero fees until March 26, 2023, or for 12 months since the introduction of the fees.
```

```
The revenue generated from the tradingf ees will go to a special “treasury-like” multisig contract, laying the foundation for Zerion’s decentralized future.

In a multisig, several people must sign a transaction to move the funds. Here are the addresses for these multisigs:

Avalanche and Optimism: 0x7d20Ab6D8aF50d87A5E8DeF46e48F4d7dC2Ea5c7
All other networks: 0x4a183b7ED67B9E14b3f45Abfb2Cf44ed22c29E54
```

### Zerion DNA

[dns](https://zerion.io/dna/) [opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/zerion-dna-onepointo)

Zerion DNA is available to anyone with a Zerion Wallet.

```
Every wallet action will change your DNA so it reflects the value of the assets you own, the amount of gas you’ve spent and the networks you use. Anyone with the Zerion Wallet can mint their DNA at no cost beyond standard network fees.
```

```
Zerion DNA is composed of six attributes that together form your on-chain footprint and each represents a layer in your NFT. Specifically, we use the following attributes to generate and evolve your Zerion DNA
```

```
Three of these attributes are relatively static in that they can only evolve in one direction or remain constant: gas spend, the number of transactions, and your NFT Age (time since it was minted).

The other three attributes (Number of tokens and Wallet/ Network balance) are dynamic and can fluctuate with market movement and frequent transactions.

Each of these attributes contributes to your on-chain footprint and helps make a statement about yourself. For example, users who are active in the Polygon ecosystem will notice their NFT features purple accessories, while those using primarily BNB will see a largely yellow avatar.
```

```
One important note: You’ll need to open your Zerion Wallet to see the most up to date changes in your DNA. We’ll update your DNA’s attributes externally on tools like Opensea once a week so you’ll need to head to the Zerion app for the most current version of your NFT.
```

```
Is Zerion DNA Transferrable?
If you move your DNA to another Zerion Wallet, its Predictable Attributes will stay the same:

Headwear: the number of transactions made;
Body: the number of weeks the DNA was held;
Background: gas spent on transactions in Zerion Wallet.
As you transact in the new wallet, these attributes will continue to evolve.

Your DNA’s Dynamic Attributes (number of tokens, wallet balance, and preferred network) will update based on the assets and value in the new wallet.
