**Standard:** [[ERC-721 Standard]]

```
The first KinoDAO mint will consist of 15,000 ERC721 standard tokens divided
into three tiers: Gold, Silver and General Admission with a tentative mint price of
0.15ETH.

There will be a maximum of five NFTs mintable per wallet with a 24 hour guestlist
sale with artwork and metadata being revealed after the mint closes.
Each NFT will have a set of associated perks and utilities that will incentivize
retention and participation in governance.
```

```
The proceeds from this mint will be used to fund the production of A Wing and a
Prayer with expenditures reported to the DAO for full transparency.

In the interests of rewarding early adoption, owning an NFT from the first mint
will grant the owner greater privileges in future mints. In addition to guaranteed
guestlist spots, the NFT will act as a multiplier with respect to governance votes
meaning that ownership of these NFTs will add weight to a memberâ€™s vote.
Trade royalties from secondary market sales will be kept by NFT Studios to cover
operational costs and producers fees.
